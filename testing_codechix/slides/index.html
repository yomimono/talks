When we've really got our heads in the code that we're testing, it seems obvious that the code either works or it doesn't; or maybe we know how to test it manually, so it seems silly to automate this testing.  -->

<!-- It's true that we usually know a function's behavior when we're writing the function, and for a little while after we're done, but it doesn't stay obvious.  And if it's someone else's code, *even if it's well-written*, it's usually not at all obvious. -->

<!-- making sure your individual units fit together.  Interfaces between modules and systems are where bugs spawn -->

<!-- implementing performance tests is highly dependent on your stack and your application; many people end up having to write their own framework -->
