# don't cross the streams; do cross the stitches

- embroidery: a form of decorative sewing used to embellish a fabric
- cross-stitch: a specific stitch forming an X shape, often worked on a gridlike woven fabric

# gridlike fabric

- evenweave (e.g. linen) - the fibers of the cloth form a grid with equal proportions
- aida - the fibers are evenly spaced and grouped to form holes specifically placed for cross-stitch

# show linen bag

# show some aida cloth

# one cross stitch

# rows

stitch one diagonal:

```
↓↗↓↗↓↗↓↗
```

then go back stitching the other over it:

```
↖↓↖↓↖↓↖↓
```

and you end up with this on the front of the fabric:

```
XXXX
```

and this on the back:

```
| | | |
```

# keep doing that a lot in different colors with a specific design

# what's quick?

- text in one color
- single rows

# what's slow?

- big fills
- lots of color changes
