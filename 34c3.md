## Where To?

+ Resilient Projects are Accessible Projects
+ The Ultimate Bad Dependency: An Unnecessary OS
+ Replacing the OS with Libraries of Your Choice
+ Increasing Resiliency by Building Good Libraries

## Resilient Projects are Accessible Projects

"bus number": the number of humans to "suddenly disappear" from a project before the project stalls due to lack of knowledegeable or compentent personnel

more humans + ease of understanding -> higher bus numbers
higher bus numbers -> more resilient projects

## Our Project Isn't Just Our Code

things to understand:
  our code +
  the language of our code +
  build chain +
  relevant environments +
  dependencies +
  ...

## A Particularly Heavy Dependency

```
+------------------------+----------------+
| User-level Application |  Dependencies  |
+------------------------+----------------+
| OS: scheduler, memory management,       |
| network, filesystems, clock, entropy,   |
| keyboard, video, power, user management,|
| mouse, screensaver, consoles, printers, |
| ...                                     |
+-----------------------------------------+
```

## The Operating System as Dependency

* really huge (and has more stuff than you need)
* not in your normal docs
* not debuggable in your normal deployment
* accessed via an alien API

## all that, for what?

Some selections from `man 2` in Linux:
```c
int socket(int domain, int type, int protocol);
/* many integer constants defined below... */
/* on success, a file descriptor is returned *.
/* on error, -1 is returned, and errno is set */

int connect(int sockfd, const struct sockaddr *addr,
            socklen_t addrlen);
/* socklen_t is "in reality an int" */
/* on success, 0 is returned */
/* on error, -1 is returned, and errno is set */
```

## Some Socket Functions

Some selections from `unix.mli` in OCaml:
```ocaml
val socket : socket_domain -> socket_type -> int -> file_descr
(** create a new socket with a given network layer implementation,
   transport layer implementation, and protocol type (0 for default).
   Throw an exception wrapping ERRNO on failure *)

val connect : file_descr -> sockaddr -> unit
(** connect a socket to an address; 
    Throw an exception wrapping ERRNO for invalid file_descr
    or connection errors *)
```

## Adding Kernel APIs

1. learn to program in the language of your kernel
2. learn the additional constraints of doing kernel programming in your kernel
3. make a patch for your change
4. learn how to test your patch
5. test your patch
6. learn how to package and submit your patch
7. get feedback: GOTO 1 or 2


## Eudyptula Challenge

> The Eudyptula Challenge was a series of programming exercises for the Linux kernel, that started from a basic "Hello world" kernel module, moving on up in complexity to getting patches accepted into the main Linux kernel source tree.

Challenge finishers: 160
Challenge participants (unique): 18913

## Resilient Communities Protect Each Other

Members of your project may want to limit their exposure to communities known for their hostility and toxicity.

This includes some famous monolithic kernel projects.

## What's the OS *really* doing for us?

```
+------------------------+----------------+
| User-level Application |  Dependencies  |
+------------------------+----------------+
           API in Your Language
+----------------------------------------+
|     Runtime (or not!), shared libs     |
+----------------------------------------+
        Sockets, syscalls, & such       
+----------------------------------------+
| OS: scheduler, memory management,      |
| network, filesystems, clock, video, ...|
+----------------------------------------+
| Hypervisor                             |
+----------------------------------------+
```

## Library Operating System

```
+---------------------------------------------------------+
|    User-level Application    |      Dependencies        |
+---------------------------------------------------------+
                 API in Your Language
+------------+---------+-------------+------------+-------+
| Networking | Storage | Timekeeping | Randomness | ....  |
+------------+---------+-------------+------------+-------+
                 API in Your Language
+---------------------------------------------------------+
| Language runtime                                        |
+---------------------------------------------------------+
| Hypervisor                                              |
+---------------------------------------------------------+
| "hardware"                                              |
+---------------------------------------------------------+
```

## What do the Libraries Look Like?

+ An interface definiton for common operations
  * "check the time", "get a random number", "send a packet", "write a file"
  * (MirageOS: module types)
+ Implementations of that interface
  * "interactions with a btrfs filesystem", "talking over an Ethernet network"
  * (MirageOS: modules)

## Connecting to Remote Hosts

```ocaml
module type TCP = sig
  val create_connection: t -> ipaddr * int -> (flow, error) result io
  (** [create_connection t (addr,port)] opens a TCPv4 connection
      to the specified endpoint. *)
end
```

## What's an Implementation Look Like?

```ocaml
  let create_connection tcp (daddr, dport) =
    Pcb.connect tcp ~dst:daddr ~dst_port:dport >>= function
    | Error e -> log_failure daddr dport e; Lwt.return @@ Error e
    | Ok (fl, _) -> Lwt.return (Ok fl)
```

## Libraries -> Unikernels

```ocaml
type output =
  | OS_process
  | Minimal_virtual_machine

val build : application -> dependencies list ->
            implementations list -> output
```

## Quick Demo - Let's Build a Website

## not only can we do it - we can do it *better*

so far, I've tried to convince you that library operating systems make it easier to do systems development by opening up development in the language of your choice

now I'll try to convince you that being able to use your language tools makes it easier to do it *well*


## Testing

>Amusing fact: my original motivation for rump kernels (2007) was to make debugging OS kernel drivers less braindead.

--@anttikantee

## Testing a MirageOS implementation

```ocaml
let test_marshal_padding () =
  let buf = Cstruct.create 8 in
  Cstruct.memset buf 255;
  let extract = Cstruct.get_uint8 buf in
  let needs_padding = [ Tcp.Options.SACK_ok ] in
  check 4 (Tcp.Options.marshal buf needs_padding);
  check 4 (extract 0);
  check 2 (extract 1);
  check 0 (extract 2); (* 0 out everything else *)
  check 0 (extract 3);
  check 255 (extract 4); (* but not into random memory *)
  Lwt.return_unit
```

## Testing Network Stack

```
$ ./test.native test tcp_options|grep -v SKIP
[OK]        tcp_options  0   unmarshal broken mss
[OK]        tcp_options  1   unmarshal option w/bogus length
[OK]        tcp_options  2   unmarshal option w/zero length
[OK]        tcp_options  3   unmarshal simple cases
[OK]        tcp_options  4   unmarshal stops at eof
[OK]        tcp_options  5   unmarshal tcp options
[OK]        tcp_options  6   unmarshal random data returns
[OK]        tcp_options  7   marshal unknown value
[OK]        tcp_options  8   marshal when padding is needed
[OK]        tcp_options  9   marshal the empty list
Test Successful in 0.015s. 10 tests run.
```

## Substituting Our Own Reality

```
type output =
  | OS_process
  | Minimal_virtual_machine

val build : application -> dependencies list ->
            implementations list -> output

let test_application = build application depends \
    my_implementation::implementations
```

## "Fun" Custom Implementations

+ network interfaces that always have new packets waiting
+ random number generators that read from a list
+ entropy sources that always block
+ filesystems that are always full
+ block devices that are always busy
+ DNS that always returns the IP of put-your-creds-here.party

## Wilder Thoughts

+ state: not just for shell examination anymore

## What if every change to /proc had a commit message?

+ Irmin: library for persistent stores w/built-in snapshot, branching, & reverting mechanisms
  - (presents interfaces that look a lot like git)
  - multiple backends, including in-memory and on-disk

## Visualizing Control Flow

+ What if the scheduler left a log?

## What About the Hypervisor?

+ we can take just the pieces we need from that, too
+ solo5 ukvm: take device requirement information and have the hypervisor only surface what's needed

## A Small Subset of Ongoing Work

+ hypervisor: solo5 + vmm for OpenBSD, Hypervisor.Framework for osx
+ libraries outside of library OS: userspace networking, docker

## On the Desktop (MirageOS + QubesOS = <3)

+ QubesOS: hypervisor + nice controls for VMs + nice UI
+ individual VMs are heavy - replace some with unikernels!
